## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt that HTML structure is very important and can help make styling easier.
dividing design to sections helped me target every section without too many selectors.


### Continued development

I need to practice more HTML & CSS to strengthen my weak points.
